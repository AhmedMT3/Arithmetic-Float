# Arithmetic Compression and Decompression Program

## Overview

This program implements arithmetic compression and decompression for text files. It includes a GUI interface, command-line interaction, and supports saving compressed files and restoring them back to their original form.

### Features:

1. **Arithmetic Compression Algorithm:** Efficiently compresses text files using probabilities of character occurrence.
2. **Decompression Support:** Reconstructs the original file from compressed data.
3. **GUI Interface:** A user-friendly interface built with `Tkinter` for compression and decompression tasks.
4. **Command-Line Utility:** For users who prefer terminal-based interaction.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AhmedMT3/Arithmetic-Float.git
   cd Arithmetic-Float
   ```

2. Set up a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
    # On Mac/Linux:
   python -m venv venv
   source ./venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows:
   myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pillow
   ```

## Usage

### GUI Mode ðŸŽ¨ 

Run the GUI application for an easy-to-use interface:

```bash
python GUI.py
```

#### Features in GUI:

- **Compress a File:** Select a text file and save it as a compressed `.arf` file.
- **Decompress a File:** Select a `.arf` file and reconstruct the original text file.

### Command-Line Mode ðŸ’»

Run the command-line interface:

```bash
python main.py
```

#### Options:

1. Compress a text file located in the `Playground/` folder.
2. Decompress a `.arf` file located in the `Playground/` folder.
3. Test the algorithm by compressing string data directly.

---

## Notes

- Ensure that all files for compression and decompression are placed in the `Playground/` directory.
- Compressed files have the `.arf` extension and contain all necessary metadata for decompression.
- GUI and CLI modes are independent; you can use either based on your preference.
